# Reasoning

Balance changes are always going to be controversial in a game as tightly designed as Battle Brothers. Nonetheless, I wanted to provide the reasoning behind the changes I made to help you decide if you wish to use the mod or not.

My goal with all of these changes was not to make the game easier or harder, but to make dominant parts of the meta less dominant and the tradeoffs between certain weapons and traits more interesting.

## Named Weapons

**Reduced armor penetration rolls**

Armor penetration is probably the single best stat on a weapon, outclassing even raw damage on many weapon types. +16% penetration at the top end is too good and makes some named weapons approach legendary item power.

**Increased armor effectiveness rolls**

Most weapons need a _substantial_ increase in armor effectiveness make the weapon actually kill faster. Bumping the average up slightly helps it scale better to a normal player's expectation of the buff.

**No more max Fatigue rolls**

These never unlock new build options or exciting capabilities with the weapon in the way that every other roll does. They're incredibly niche at best and completely useless at worst.

## Perks

**Sword Mastery no longer removes Riposte hit malus, add Riposte defense boost**

Riposte is a tough sell. You have to spend more Fatigue than you would for an attack, be attacked, be missed, and then still land a hit in order for it to do anything. This is pretty underwhelming on 1H sword damage.

Giving Riposte a defense boost means it's easier to trigger Ripostes in the first place, but inexperienced bros will still struggle to land hits. This keeps some of the theming that this is an advanced technique in place, and opens up some build synergies with other perks like Fast Adaptation.

**Taunt costs less Fatigue**

Dedicated shield bros already have a bunch of Fatigue hungry skills, and other builds that could use Taunt in an interesting way already have to spend 4 AP to do so. Having it _also_ cost as much Fatigue as a 6AP 2H attack without mastery (debatably more, since getting attacked also builds up Fatigue) is unnecessary.

## Retinue

**Scout increases speed only on rough terrain, is now called the Guide**

The Scout is a boring auto-pick because he makes you do everything better. Increasing his bonus on rough terrain (where it has the biggest impact) and having it not apply at all on e.g. Roads makes him a more compelling pick for exploring the wilderness and on maps with lots of rough terrain instead of a good pick no matter what and at any point of a campaign.

Also it doesn't make logical sense why being able to "navigate treacherous swamps" would make you move any faster on Roads.

He's now called "the Guide" because that's what he does.

## Traits

**Increased damage boost on Brute**

This one likely seems excessive at first glance. The trait has a couple quirks that hamper it relative to other damage increasing perks like Drunkard or Huge, however. Brute only affects _hitpoint_ damage to the head and is applied after damage reduction from armor, so the boost applies to only a small fraction of the overall damage output (and it completely nullified by Steel Brow).

Also, Brute is not multiplicative, which results in less impressive results than players are used to seeing from a +% increase in bbros (for example, Brute + the 1H axe Chop skill give a total bonus to head hit damage of +65% - `1.5 + 1.15` - rather than 72% - `1.5 * 1.15`, which is how most other % bonuses in the game work).

All this would still be fine, except the Melee Skill malus of the trait counteracts this meager bonus. Turtle (of [Perk Guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2001196860) fame) did some testing around this on Head Hunter builds and determined that even those builds actually kill _slower_ with Brute than they do with just +5 Melee Skill and no extra head hit damage. He suggested 30% damage was around where the needle starts to shift.

It's generally a good thing for traits to encourage builds on bros, and while head hunter builds are a good way to "salvage" a bro who already has Brute, I feel that it's better to have Brute be a potentially exciting reason to hire a bro in the first place.

**Increased Resolve on Cocky**

It's ok for traits to be bad, and Cocky is still bad; -5 Defense is a massive malus. Increasing the Resolve boost just makes it a little more interesting on low Resolve backgrounds that need the boost, talented characters who can overcome the malus, and sergeant builds.

**Lowered damage malus on Tiny**

-15% damage is enough to disqualify a bro as a damage dealer. Lowering this makes the decision a bit more interesting, and offers some nice numeric symmetry with the bonus from Huge.

## Tryout

**Tryout gives XP gain**

I don't think tryout is as broken or useless a mechanic as much of the playerbase seems to, and the mods that make tryout show talents are impossible to balance well. That said, I do think that it's a bit of a "feels bad" mechanic when you try a bro out and discover that he's...totally fine. You just spent a bunch of extra money on a bro you already wanted to hire.

Offering a small reward for trying a bro out helps make the mechanic _feel_ a lot better without upsetting hiring balance.

## Weapons

**Handgonnes have a tighter damage range**

Handgonnes are stronk and could use a lower upper bound, but also a 40 point damage range is flail territory and feels janky on weapons that aren't built around fishing for criticals.

**Increased damage for Greatswords**

Poor Greatswords have been nerfed a few times since release (they were once 85-110 @ 35% penetration and 120% armor effectiveness), while several new 2H have been added that outpace it. Greatswords are intended to be "jack of all trades" two handers that trade raw effectiveness for flexibility, but their low armor penetration hampers their ability to kill even lightly armored opponents such that they lag behind more specialized weapons put into the same role. Bumping their damage output a bit nudges them back towards that "adequate but not great" territory they're supposed to live in.

**Heavy Rusty Axes have a wider damage range**

a 15 point damage range is incredibly tight for a 2H, let alone what's already considered one of the best 2H in the game.

**Javelins now have 3 ammo per stack**

Throwers dominate ranged options due to their massive damage with Mastery and Duelist, and the high base armor penetration of javelins contributes substantially to that. Reducing their stack size puts a limit on their damage output without killing any builds or perk synergies, and helps nudge builds towards throwing specialization with Bags & Belts, or generalization by encouraging a backup plan when you run out.

Also it just seems like 5 javelins is a lot to carry around ready to throw.

**Aimed Shot buffs**

Bows lag behind all other ranged options, but are uniquely capable of super long range attacks. As it stands, however, bows still have underwhelming hit chances and damage when trying to fill that sniper role.

**Lunge scaling, damage floor**

Fencers are the most stat-demanding build in the game, and don't offer a commesurate effectiveness. Making them slightly less demanding opens up the build to more talented bros. The lack of a damage floor in the base game just feels like an oversight.
